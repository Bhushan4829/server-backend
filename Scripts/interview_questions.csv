In my project, GDP Prediction using XGBoost, I utilized various methods to handle missing values, including interpolation, imputation, and elimination.

**Step 1: Identifying Missing Values**

The first step in handling missing values is to identify them. In our dataset, we discovered numerous null values, with some counts exceeding 16,000. We used the `isnull()` function in Python to detect missing values and counted the number of null values in each column.

**Step 2: Interpolation**

For columns with missing values, we used interpolation to fill in the null values. Interpolation involves estimating the missing values based on the values of neighboring data points. We used the `interpolate()` function in Python to interpolate the missing values in 22 columns. Additionally, we interpolated the population data based on country, as the population data was correlated with the country.

**Step 3: Imputation**

For the ""continent"" column, we imputed the null values for African countries, as all cases with missing continent data were recognized as African countries. Imputation involves replacing missing values with a specific value, such as the mean or median of the column.

**Step 4: Elimination**

We eliminated rows and columns with excessive missing values. Specifically, we:

* Elim **Step 4: Elimination**

* Eliminated columns with more than 50% missing values to prevent bias in the model.
* Dropped rows with missing values in critical columns, such as the target variable, to ensure accurate predictions.
